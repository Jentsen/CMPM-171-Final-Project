# Crabity
Crabity is a 2D/3D puzzle platformer co-op game where the players are robot crabs navigating through levels, gaining an inventory of new parts that will allow them to rejoin their real crab friends in the ocean! With seemingly impossible levels, the player needs to change their perspective and harness the power of gravity to gain access to previously unreachable platforms.
