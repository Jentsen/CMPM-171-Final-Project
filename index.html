    <h2>Game Constraints</h2>
    <p>Our game was designed under the following externally imposed constraints:</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Accessibility</b>: </li>
      <p></p>
      <ul>

        <li>
          <b>Limited Vision (Seeing)</b>
          <p>
            <i>Requirement</i>: the game needed to be completable even when simulating vision limitations such as
            constrast and color
            sensitivity.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Team's design:</i>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To highlight interactable elements, we used continuous motion on objects to make them stand out to the
              player.
              The motion made the objects go up and down, hinting to the player that they are items that have purpose in
              the game.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
              To fulfill this requirement, we also made our game indepedent of color. For example, there is no point in
              the game where the player
              needs to grab a blue key or a red key to go through a blue or red door, respectively.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
              The in-game camera rotation UI element that appears in the second puzzle in the bottom-right is a product
              of careful design from the
              team. At first, we wanted to create a UI element that highlights the platform you are on with a color, but
              by thinking of the
              limiting vision constraint, we came up with an arrow that points to the house and follows it around so
              that the player does not
              need to depend on color to understand where they are.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <p></p>
        <li>
          <b>Limited Dexterity (Touching)</b>
          <p>
            <i>Requirement:</i> the game must be completable by a player using just one hand of the controls at a time.
          </p>
          <p><i>Team's design:</i></p>
          <ul>
            <p>
              <li>
                Our game does not require both mouse and keyboard input at the same time.
              </li>
            </p>
            <p>
              <li>
                While playing the game, the controls are all of the left side of the keyboard, and can be played with
                only one hand.
              </li>
            </p>
            <p>
              <li>
                In the main menu, the player can use either a trackpad or a mouse to click on play, settings, or
                credits.
              </li>
            </p>
            <p>
              <li>
                By keeping our controls simple, we were able to make a game that feels good to play with only one hand.
              </li>
            </p>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <p></p>
        <li>
          <b>Limited Audition (Hearing)</b>
          <p>
            <i>Requirement:</i> the game must be completable by a player who cannot hear any sounds from the game.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Team's design:</i>
          </p>

          <ul>
            <p>
              <li>
                To make our game completable by a player who cannot hear any sounds, we designed our game to not be
                depedent on sound cues.
              </li>
            </p>
            <p>
              <li>
                We have included background music in our game for ambiance, but the sound can be turned all the way off
                and nothing would change
                in terms of the gameplay.
              </li>
            </p>
            <p>
              <li>
                To communicate controls and story with the player, we used a dialogue box on the left of the screen that
                the player can interact with.
                By having this dialogue box with no voice attached to it, our game is completable without any sound
                cues.
              </li>
            </p>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <p></p>
        <li>
          <b>Limited Energy and Attention (Resting)</b>
          <p>
            <i>Requirement:</i> during a completion run of the game, gameplay should always reach a natural resting
            point within two minutes
            of active play without the player needing to take an extra action to pause the game.
          </p>

          <p>
            <i>Team's design:</i>
          </p>

          <ul>
            <p>
              <li>
                We designed our game to not have enemies, as you are your only enemy when it comes to solving puzzles.
                With this design philosophy, you can rest at any point in a level.
              </li>
            </p>
            <p>
              <li>
                In our next capstone course, CMPM 172 (Game Production Studio), we are planning to adding enemies, where
                we will need to
                introduce some rest areas in between levels and in a level itself. For example, this could come in the
                form of a platform where no
                enemies can come near you.
              </li>
            </p>
          </ul>
        </li>

      </ul>

      <p></p>
      <li>
        <b>Localization:</b>
        <p>
          <i>Requirement:</i> the game must support two different written languages. At least one language must use
          either a logographic script
          or a right-to-left script.
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>Team's design:</i>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <p>
            <li>
              To fullfil this requirement, we included a button in the main menu that switches the locale of the game to
              Arabic.
            </li>
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>
              We downloaded a font specificially for Arabic characters, and used Unity's RTL editor to port Arabic
              sentences properly.
            </li>
          </p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <p>
            <li>
              The game must be completable while the player's device is disconnected from the internet.
            </li>
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>
              The total data transfer involved in downloading the game must be less than 100 MiB.
            </li>
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>
              The game may target the platform of the team's choice, however if Windows is supported, macOS must also
              be supported in principle.
            </li>
          </p>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>

        <ul>
          <p>
            <li>
              Our game is supported for both macOS and Windows, and both are below 100 MiB when transferred.
            </li>
          </p>
          <p>
            <li>
              By using Unity's crunch compression tool and compressing the assets used, we are able to achieve this file

    <h2>Rapid Prototyping</h2>
    <li><b>Minecraft Prototypes</b>: </li>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          First, Jentsen and Daniel began our rapid prototyping in Minecraft; with the quick installation of the mods
          Freecam and Gravity Changer, we were able to create a basic prototype of what would be our game.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/gifs/jentsen_1.gif" alt="Jentsen and Daniel Minecraft Prototype" width="500">
        <p>
          We quickly noted that by changing the gravitational axis, the controls of the game can feel a bit challenging
          to understand. Thus, we made sure to keep the controls the same regardless of the gravitational axis which
          helped alleviate player confusion in future builds.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <li><b>Unity Prototypes:</b></li>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Lukas was also able to generate a quick idea of what the camera switching would look like in Unity using
          primitives. This first introduced the idea that players would ONLY be allowed to move left and right.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/gifs/lukas_1.gif" alt="Lukas Prototype" width="500">
        <p>
          However, we weren't completely sure if the snappy camera movement was exactly what we wanted.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Ernani generated another prototype revolving around smoother camera rotations. This ended up being the main
          script that we used in our final build. At the same time, he was able to use Github actions to auto build our
          Unity prototypes; this allowed us to expedite and test our games faster on our site compared to having to
          manually build the game over and over again.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/gifs/ernani_1.gif" alt="Ernani Prototype" width="500">
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Lukas also created another protoype that centered around the idea of pushing objects onto a platform to reveal
          new parts around the level. This opened the door for the idea of secret passages and easter eggs. However,
          this ended up being a bit confusing for some players as we saw during playtests they weren't sure exactly what
          to do with the spheres. Also, the rigid bodies on the spheres made it difficult for some players to guide
          around.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/gifs/lukas_2.gif" alt="Lukas Prototype 2" width="500">
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Jentsen was working on a seemingly 2D prototype for the gravity mechanic we wanted to include in the game. At
          this point, the x, y, and z rotations of the player object were not locked, allowing players to realize that
          this was actually a 3D game viewed through a 2D camera. This unlocked a plethora of new level design
          possibilities
          for us to explore in the future.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/gifs/jentsen_2.gif" alt="Jentsen Prototype 2" width="500">
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Afterwards, Jentsen quickly threw multiple aspects of our prototypes together and we ended up with the
          base for our mechanics in our final prototype.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/gifs/jentsen_3.gif" alt="Jentsen Prototype 3" width="500">
        <p>
          But there were bound to be a few bugs while we were developing the game.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/gifs/rotation_bug.gif" alt="Jentsen Prototype 2" width="500">
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Lastly, after adding some free assets from the asset store, we gradually began crafting the narrative of the
          game. Jentsen noted that he came up with the idea of centering the story around a crab, as they are known for
          primarily moving left and right. With a few more assets, we decided to pursue our initial idea of a steampunk
          environment for the robot crab to explore, seeking objects that would enable it to survive in the ocean like a
          real crab. Finally, the game was starting to come together.

      <li>
        <b>Akhror Rakhmatov:</b>
        <p>
          "I worked on the main menu, options menu, some of the sound as well as the background music.
          I was able to create the background music from scratch using Native Access's Maschine DAW.
          The main menu was created with the intention of making a menu that's not too basic and fits into the
          same theme and genre that the game is played in. The options menu continues on from that same menu."

          "I worked on the camera rotation mechanic and contributed to prototyping player movement.
          I contributed into the deployment process of our game, as we wanted an easy way
          to automatically create builds through Github actions that published the game on our site.
          I also contributed in level design, specifically levels 2 and 3, to create a fun experience for the player.
          Lastly, I worked on integrating Unity’s Localization Tool to make the game playable in both English and
          Arabic."

          "I was the Co-Design Lead as well as the Production Lead! For level design, I worked on Level 1, but my 
          primary focus was on the game's core mechanics, such as gravity shifting, restricted side-to-side and 
          situational up and down movement, as well as reworking the camera rotation to prevent motion sickness. 
          Additionally, with the use of a few simple mathematical equations, I was able to make the movement feel 
          snappy and responsive. Furthermore, I implemented the fading object shader that our game uses to allow players 
          to see inside the level. I also worked on a large portion of the game's debugging. For production, I ensured 
          that our team stayed on track by implementing Notion into our workflow. This allowed us to easily keep track of 
          what was being worked on and by whom. After listening to players' feedback during playtests, I helped alleviate 
          confusion by adding a minimap to indicate level orientation. Lastly, I was largely responsible for maintaining 
          the aesthetic of the game by importing assets and creating the environment and narrative."

          "I worked on the pause menu and various UI aspects of the game.
          I also added assets and level design to puzzle 3 to make it look interesting artistically.
          I built a lot of pipes from scratch to make a level that would be fun to play from multiple angles.
          I made sure the pause menu could be fully accessible using one hand through
          hotkeys such as 1, 2, 3, and 4 for resume, menu, restart, and exit. I also implemented audio control,
          mute, volume slider, and UI assets. I also did bits of debugging to improve the overall functionality
          and polish of the game."
